# System1Bench: Benchmarking Jev-Style Decision Models

[![Verify benchmark artifacts](https://github.com/CYMCharming/system1bench/actions/workflows/verify.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CYMCharming/system1bench/actions/workflows/verify.yml)

**System 1 决策模型评测基准** · An independent, reproducible evaluation collection
for models that turn a supplied state into typed `choice`, `noul` and `score`
decisions.

**The historical full-matrix systems are Laya English, Laya Multilingual,
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B and the pinned Jev 1.13.0 API.**
**The new controlled expansion adds Kev-0.8B, Kev-4B, Kev-9B,
NanoJev (unified games) and Qwen3.5-9B.**
**The follow-up extension adds Kev-27B v2 and official Qwen3.5-0.8B/4B
and Qwen3.8-27B checkpoints on the same frozen requests.**
“Jev-style” describes the interface/task category, not a shared architecture.

System1Bench combines 15 public source datasets/collections into 36 suites and
controls. It covers semantic classification, bilingual inference, structured
workflow decisions, explicit out-of-scope intent detection, safety, long-context
retrieval and actual option-order perturbations. Scores stay separate by source
and reference quality. There is no blended “decision intelligence” score.
An independently frozen legal/scientific extension is reported separately from
this historical 15-source matrix.

## Fourteen-model follow-up leaderboard

The [fourteen-model follow-up](research/leaderboard_v2/REPORT.zh-CN.md)
retains the original ten results and adds four independently measured,
revision-pinned checkpoints. Every model has the same 4,905 typed decisions
from 2,601 requests; the [new run verification](research/model_expansion_v2/verification.json)
replays exact case, gold-label and request-hash matches. The three-domain
index remains a descriptive navigation aid, while the separate domain and
robustness rankings preserve source-reference differences.

Kev-27B v2 starts from the already post-trained Qwen3.8-27B base, whereas
the smaller Kev bases are Qwen3.5-Base. Kev-9B in the earlier leaderboard is
an older pinned release. Differences are measured on the same prompts but
are **not** controlled causal effects of size or model architecture. Qwen
uses direct candidate-code likelihood with thinking off; its generative
reasoning ceiling is outside this evaluation.

## Ten-model leaderboards (archived snapshot)

The [ten-model leaderboard](research/leaderboard_v1/REPORT.zh-CN.md) ranks the
five historical and five newly evaluated systems on exactly the same **4,905
decisions per model**. Its descriptive three-domain index equally weights
executable policy actions, ContractNLI labels and cited SciFact labels; it is
not a replacement for the separate-source historical benchmark. Jev 1.13.0
API leads this sample index at **82.5%**, followed by Qwen3.5-9B (**81.1%**)
and Kev-9B (**80.2%**). If the three individual policies and two natural tasks
instead receive equal weight, **Kev-9B leads at 84.1%**. Domain-specific
rankings and the reference-quality caveats matter more than either single rank.

## New official-model expansion

Five new pinned models completed **24,525 new decisions**, with complete inputs
and zero invalid outputs, on executable refund/access/routing rules, ContractNLI
and the cited SciFact three-label panel. An additional **6,912 new decisions**
compare Kev-4B and Kev-9B on previously unused policy states. This is a separate
controlled extension: the five new models have **not** yet rerun every row of the
historical 15-source matrix below. Historical same-payload comparisons are reused
with explicit source receipts, not counted as new inference.

![Five-model workload-specific accuracy](paper/figures/fig_model_expansion_accuracy.png)

A stable answer may be stably wrong. On scientific evidence, NanoJev has zero
reversal flips but **213/339 wrong-and-stable** predictions. Its game-specialized
checkpoint makes this an out-of-domain transfer diagnostic, not a general-quality
verdict. Qwen3.5 has **283/339** base agreements vs Kev-4B's **274/339**, but
**250/339** vs **265/339** correct-and-stable reversal pairs; the sample ranking
changes, without a statistically secure superiority claim.

![Prospective policy replication](paper/figures/fig_model_expansion_replication.png)

On new routing pairs, Kev-4B gets both actions correct in **68/96** cases, Kev-9B
in **56/96**. Refund joint success instead improves **82/96 → 96/96**. Routing's
pointwise interval excludes zero, but its six-effect guarded interval reaches
zero. These are checkpoint-specific workload shifts, not a causal size law;
training histories differ. Qwen uses direct code likelihood, thinking off.
See the reports for every head, class, confidence slice and counterexample.

## Beyond aggregate accuracy

The fresh policy diagnostic evaluates 288 base states, eight matched variants and
three output primitives on all five systems. Separate LLM controls change display
order and answer-code identity independently. In Llama access-control decisions,
changing only codes flips 55.2% of predictions, while changing both display and
codes flips none. Combined reversal can therefore hide sensitivity to its components.
These findings describe the fixed adapters, not an architectural cause.

![Orthogonal display and answer-code controls](paper/figures/fig_codebook.png)

Each policy/model uses 96 base clusters; whiskers are pointwise paired 95% intervals.
All conditions, including null and contrary effects, are retained in the
[fresh report](research/CONFIRMATION_RESULTS.en.md). The
[post-hoc error localization](research/POSTHOC_DIAGNOSTICS.en.md) and
[six-effect simultaneous-interval figure](paper/figures/fig_confirmation.svg)
provide complementary diagnostics. Synthetic policies test supplied-rule execution,
and have not received independent human construct or bilingual validation.

## Measured results — all tasks

**Every score below comes from our own model runs and API calls. No third-party model scores are copied.**

4 checkpoints × 26,450 decisions = **105,800 measured decisions**, including controls. Failures: **0**; complete inputs: **105,800/105,800**.

Laya uses native decision heads. The Llama and Qwen baselines use zero-shot constrained next-token answer selection; Qwen thinking is disabled. See the [exact comparison protocol](docs/LLM_BASELINES.md). These are fixed direct-decision baselines, not best-achievable LLM scores.

Values are accuracy against each source reference. **Teacher/synthetic and authored/AI-reviewed rows measure reference agreement**, not independently human-verified correctness. We publish all suites without an overall blended score. Full confidence intervals, F1, Brier/ECE, ordinal errors, language/length slices and timings are in the [report](docs/RESULTS.zh-CN.md), [CSV](results/metrics.csv) and [JSON](results/summary.json).

The pinned **Jev 1.13.0** hosted track adds **26,450 decisions** from 22,934 requests, with **8 invalid decisions counted as incorrect**. Full client payloads were sent; server tokenization is unverified. [Jev report and all intervals](docs/JEV_RESULTS.en.md).

New research: [paired insights](research/INSIGHTS.en.md), [fresh policy interventions and codebook controls](research/CONFIRMATION_RESULTS.en.md). Local GPU timing and hosted network observations are separate tracks.

### Option-order agreement

Agreement compares predictions on the same inputs; it is not accuracy. The LLM reversal also reassigns answer codes.

### Explicit out-of-scope detection (CLINC150 + OOS)

| Model | In-scope accuracy | OOS precision | OOS recall | OOS F1 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|

| Qwen3-8B | 65.93% | 57.52% | 76.10% | 0.6552 |

### Ordinal scoring (SST5, fixed 0–4 scale)

Lower MAE is better; within-one agreement allows an error of one scale point.

| Model | Argmax MAE ↓ | Expected-score MAE ↓ | Within one ↑ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Laya English | 0.9270 | 0.9144 | 77.80% |

Requests include all questions in a state. Fixed-batch throughput is completed requests divided by summed prediction time; it is not server capacity. No generated-token speed, optimal-serving-engine result, architecture-only speedup, or overall cross-task winner is claimed. Jev was not run in this resident-GPU track.

<!-- END GENERATED PERFORMANCE -->

## Run provenance

The original Laya measurements are retained from v0.1. The two LLM runs are
new in v0.2; no prior result is relabeled as a new run. Every model has
per-suite compressed raw predictions and a completed-run manifest:
[Laya English](results/english/metadata.json),
[Laya Multilingual](results/multilingual/metadata.json),
[Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct](results/llama31_8b_instruct/metadata.json),
[Qwen3-8B](results/qwen3_8b/metadata.json).

## Reproduce

Python 3.11+ and a CUDA GPU are required for the Laya runs. The reference run used
Python 3.12, PyTorch 2.7.1+cu118, Transformers 5.16.1 and Laya 0.3.20. Laya source
hashes and model byte hashes appear in each model's metadata. A shared environment with
incompatible PyTorch/Transformers versions may need a fresh virtual environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CYMCharming/system1bench.git
cd system1bench
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[laya]'
python -m system1bench.download
python -m system1bench.prepare
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -m system1bench.run --model english --output my-results
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -m system1bench.run --model multilingual --output my-results
python -m system1bench.metrics --results my-results
python -m system1bench.report --results my-results
```

Downloads use immutable revisions and verify SHA256. Standard source data are
stored locally under `data/`; they are not covered by this repository's license.
The checked-in `results/` are the published runs. Use a new output directory for
a different environment, checkpoint, code or batch size. Interrupted suites are
rerun atomically; completed suites must match input/configuration fingerprints.

To verify/recompute the published numbers without downloading data or a model:

```bash
pip install -e .
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python -m system1bench.metrics
python -m system1bench.report
```

The compressed per-suite results contain source IDs, gold labels, raw answers,
probabilities, request hashes, token audits and per-batch timing. They omit
original text and rationale annotations. A reader can reconstruct requests from
pinned sources and recompute all published metrics independently.

Llama/Qwen reproduction, prompt conversion and probability semantics are documented in
[LLM_BASELINES.md](docs/LLM_BASELINES.md). These local baselines use the exact same frozen inputs.

## Add Jev or another model

Implement the adapter contract in [ADAPTERS.md](docs/ADAPTERS.md), then use
`--adapter your_package.module:Adapter --model your_model_name`. The runner passes
only state and questions; source references are separate. Keep native raw answers
and declare model/version, prompt conversion, probability semantics and input
budget limitations. No Jev credentials, paid API calls, mocked leaderboard runs
or copied third-party model scores are included.

## Interpretation

Classification accuracy is a component measure, not end-to-end agent success.
Several workflow references are synthetic/teacher labels; their scores measure
agreement. Public data may overlap model training, and AG News/BoolQ are known
training-task families for Laya. Chinese states mostly use English instructions.

Laya runs use an 8,192-token maximum and 4,096-token prompt-head budget, but
Laya internally caps each candidate description at 48 tokens. Read the actual
truncation audits and the **shared complete-input subset** before comparing
checkpoints. A larger configured budget alone does not prove full input retention.
