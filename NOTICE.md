Laya is developed by NandhaKishorM / Convai Innovations. Jev is associated with
TypeSafe AI. System1Bench is an independent evaluation project, not an official
benchmark, endorsement or product of those organizations.

The local v0.2 baselines use Qwen3-8B (Qwen, Apache 2.0) and
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (Meta, Llama 3.1 Community License). This repository
publishes evaluation code and outputs, not model weights. Model terms and
required access remain with the original publishers; our MIT license does not
replace them. Exact checkpoint byte/revision verification is linked in
[LLM_BASELINES.md](docs/LLM_BASELINES.md).
